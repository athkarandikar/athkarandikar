## 👋 Hi there, I'm Atharva Karandikar.  
### 🛠️ Skills  
I am detail-oriented, a good leader, enthusiastic, and naturally curious. I like to plan, organize, and optimize things. I am proficient at are Java, C/C++, JavaScript, and SQL programming languages. On the web development side, I’m proficient in frameworks like NextJS and ReactJS. I am always open to learning technologies based on project needs.  
### 🎓 Education  
I am currently in my third year pursuing a BTech in Computer Engineering at Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune, with a CGPA of 8.62 out of 10.  
Prior to that, I completed a diploma in Computer Engineering after 10th standard from Government Polytechnic Solapur. I finished my schooling at St. Joseph High School, Solapur - a convent school.  
### 💼 Experience  
I have demonstrated leadership in 2 major roles: I’m currently the project lead for a government-funded project, and previously, I served as the headboy at my school, helping maintain discipline throughout the school. I was a technical team member at the coding forum at my college. During my diploma, my team organized a coding competition. I have anchored my school’s annual day event for 800+ audience.  
### 🛠️ Projects  
I have developed a 2-pass assembler in Java for the assembly language – it’s the most complex piece of code I have written so far. I also built a chat web app with sentiment analysis, a tic tac toe game in Java Swing and AWT using custom UI components, and a robust vehicle insurance management system in C++.  
### 📜 Courses and Certifications  
I hold a Google Project Management certification from Coursera. I completed a course on Python between my 9th and 10th standard holidays – that’s where my interest in computer engineering began. I’ve also completed a course on NextJS and ReactJS. I also hold a BluePrism Associate Developer certification in robotic process automation.
