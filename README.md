## 👋🏻 Hi there, I'm Atharva Karandikar.  
### 🧠 Summary
I'm a detail-oriented, good leader, enthusiastic, and naturally curious computer engineering student. I demonstrated leadership by serving as the project lead for a government-funded project and the headboy at my school. I'm a proactive learner passionate about developing optimized solutions that enhance user experience. I am proficient in Java, C/C++, JavaScript programming languages, and SQL. On the web development side, I’m proficient in frameworks like NextJS and ReactJS.  

### 🎓 Education
I am in my fourth year pursuing a BTech in Computer Engineering at Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune, with a CGPA of 8.8 out of 10.  
Before that, I completed a diploma in Computer Engineering after my 10th standard from Government Polytechnic Solapur. I finished schooling at St. Joseph High School, Solapur - a convent school.  

### 💼 Experience
- I served as the project lead for a government-funded project.
- I was a technical team member at the coding forum at my college.    

### 🌟 Extracurriculars/Volunteering
- During my diploma, my team organized a coding competition.
- I was the headboy at my school, helping maintain discipline throughout the school.
- I anchored my school’s annual day event for 800+ audience.  

### 🛠️ Projects
My projects include a vehicle logbook system logging vehicle license plates using ML, a 2-pass assembler in Java for the assembly language, a chat web app with sentiment analysis, a tic-tac-toe game in Java Swing and AWT using custom UI components, and a robust vehicle insurance management system in C++.  

### 📜 Courses and Certifications
I hold a Google Project Management certification from Coursera. I completed a course on Python between my 9th and 10th standard holidays – that’s where my interest in computer engineering began. I’ve also completed a course on NextJS and ReactJS. I also hold a BluePrism Associate Developer certification in robotic process automation.
